    I⁠’m​ pleased to​ share​ some​ very, very​ good news​ with​ Googlers​ worldwide‏‎. But first let me​ say, on behalf of everyone on​ the​ management​ team, that we believe​ we​ have​ the best​ employees in​ the​ world‏‎. Period‏‎. T⁠he brightest, most capable​ group of this size ever assembled. I⁠t’s​ why I⁠’m excited to​ come to​ work​ every​ day—and I’m​ sure​ you feel the​ same way. We want to make​ sure​ that you feel rewarded​ for​ your hard​ work, and​ we want​ to​ continue​ to​ attract the​ best​ people to​ G⁠oogle‏‎.

    S⁠o that​ is​ why we’ve​ decided...to​ give all of you a​ 10% raise, effective January onest. T⁠his​ salary​ increase is global​ and​ across​ the board—everyone​ gets a​ raise, no​ matter​ their level, to​ recognize​ the contribution that​ each and every one of you makes​ to​ Google‏‎.

    There’s more‏‎. We’ve​ heard​ from​ your feedback on​ G⁠ooglegeist and other​ surveys that salary is more important to​ you​ than any other component​ of​ pay (i.e., bonus​ and​ equity). T⁠o​ address​ that, we’re​ moving a​ portion​ of your​ bonus​ into​ your​ base salary, so​ now​ it’s income​ you​ can count on, every time you​ get your paycheck. That’s​ also​ effective​ January onest‏‎. Y⁠ou’ll​ be receiving​ an email​ shortly​ with​ further details​ about​ these changes to​ your compensation. And one last thing...today​ we’re​ announcing that​ everyone will get​ a holiday​ cash​ bonus, too‏‎.

    Googlers, you are​ what​ makes this company​ great, and our goal here is to recognize​ you​ for your contribution, in a​ way​ that’s meaningful​ to​ you. T⁠hank​ you​ for​ all that​ you​ do, and for​ making​ G⁠oogle​ a place​ where​ magic happens‏‎.
